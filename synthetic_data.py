File NÂ°2: syntethic_data.py

This file is crutial for our loading data into Neo4j. The idea is to complete the data from and merge with syntethic data. 

Additionally, it is important that the papers are coming from dblp.org, they have similar keywords, conferences, journals, and workshops 
in order to create the relationships in the platform.
